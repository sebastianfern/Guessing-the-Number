# Guessing-the-Number
Simple number guessing game

Python program where a user is prompted to guess a program generated number within 5 tries. The program generates a random number between 0-100.

Should the user guess wrong, the program responds by telling them their guess is either too low or too high. If the user runs out of guesses the program notifies the user of the winning number ans the user is prompted to play again. When the user guesses right, the user is notified and the program asks them if they want to play again.
