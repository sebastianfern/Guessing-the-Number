# Guessing-the-Number
Simple number guessing game

Python program where a user is prompted to guess a random number in a certain amount of tries. The program generates a random number between 0-100.

Should the user guess wrong, the program responds by telling them their guess is either too low or too high. When the user guesses right, the user is notified and the program asks them if they want to play again.
